# Bluenex's React Native App

So, I am getting very serious about React especially React Native. However, everyday tasks in the real job are not suitable to be a playground, and yes this project should teach me what I want to try.. even though something might be pointless here.

This repo is intended to be a collection of knowledge of what I have stumbled upon, and more to know in the future. First things to play around are:

- Manage app state with Redux.
- Try middleware like [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) and [redux-saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga).
- Test with Jest and Enzyme.
- Use [Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components).
- Have own [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).
